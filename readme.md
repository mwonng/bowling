>if time permits implement the rules for the last frame (i.e, 10th frame)
>
>In the last frame, if the bowler bowls a spare, they get another bowl. The score of this frame is the sum of the three bowls.
>In the last frame, if the bowler bowls a strike, they get another 2 bowls. The score of this frame is the sum of the three bowls
>If one has a strike for every roll, their score is 300i

## Assumption
- it won't have any invalid input, which means it will always has a vaild frame, for example it won't in half of one frame or end with only 9 frames.
- getScore function won't be called if a game not finished yet.
- all input roll should be valid until it finished and you should always have 10 frames and sometimes might be 11 or 12 frames, but code dont have this concern done in logic.
